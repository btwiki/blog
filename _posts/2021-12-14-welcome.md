# We're sorry in advance

This blog is going to be full of a lot of random content,
and a lot of stuff that we just think of randomly while
working on projects.

This post will serve as a sort of format template so we
don't forget either lol

<br/>
# Format rules

- Newlines are ignored. Double newlines act as section spacers.
- To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces
- #, ##, and ### are three levels of header
- Mathjax can be enabled by `usemathjax: true` in the header
- `*Asterisks*` make *italics*
- `**More of them**` make **bold text**

Mathjax can be used mid-line like $$E=mc^2$$ or put on its own line  

$$E=mc^2$$  

But both are formatted as `$$math$$`

> Blockquotes can be made using `> to mark the text`
>
>> Nested blockquotes can be made `>> by simply adding more`
>
> **Formatting** works in blockquotes 

<br/>
- Unordered lists work by
- simply starting each line with
- a `- `

<br/>
1. Ordered lists work by
2. putting a number instead,
3. like `4. `

<br/>
The rest of markdown should be hopefully self-explanatory.  
A sample post front matter can also be found below. Enjoy!
